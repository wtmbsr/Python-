#Some suggested tools before you get started:
#To take input from a user:

player1 = input("Please pick a marker 'X' or 'O'")

Note that input() takes in a string. If you need an integer value, use

position = int(input('Please enter a number'))


#To clear the screen between moves:

from IPython.display import clear_output
clear_output()

#Note that clear_output() will only work in jupyter. To clear the screen in other IDEs, consider:

print('\n'*100)
